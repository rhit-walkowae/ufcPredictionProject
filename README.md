# UFC Prediction Project
Machine Learning Project for predicting the winner of a UFC fight
  
NOTE: in PredictionAlgorithms file the code section to create the dataFrame requires the UFCdata.csv file to be in the same location this projects folder will be (NOT the same location as the PredicitonAlgorithms.ipynb file)
  
  This means if your ufcPredictionProject repo folder gets cloned to your desktop your UFCdata.csv file should also be at your desktop.
